# STRANGE

A simulator of for planning the game of life.

Discussions so far:
1. Base dimension to operate on will something like; time, cash delta, cash projection. This will be a sufficient description at any point in time of a person's credit and debit state.
2. A scenario, or alternate reality, is formed by a set of events that will occur within the simulation timespan. This will be nothing but a fix set of alterations to the dimensions in (1).
3. A simulation is a generator of the scenarios, which will include variance in the statistical variables. This is where we encode decision boundaries and weights.

Levels of abstraction:
1. Data layer - This will be the numpy arrays which already encode the data generated by one simulation
2. Scenario layer - This describes a certain sequence of events, from which we collapse into the Data layer, to plot with.
3. Simulation layer - This describes a set of if-else choices, from which we simulate the possibilities to generate the Scenario layer.
